# morse-code-trainer
Put your morse code skills to the test with this handy little program ;-)

DESCRIPTION:

This is just a fun project I made for myself to learn morse code. When you run the program, click on any key to begin using the program (except for the DELETE and ESC keys, as those have special functions in the program). It will translate your key clicks into morse code characters based on how long you press them. You can see which character you're currently on in a window at the bottom of the screen, and if you mess up your timing, a sound will play.

DEPENDENCIES:

Pip packages:
  - pynput
  - pygame
  - numpy

Files:
  - amogus.mp3 (you can download it from the repository)
